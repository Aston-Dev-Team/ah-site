  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question: "What is a hackathon?"
      answer: >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question: "How much does it cost?"
      answer: >
        Nothing! Attending a hackathon is free! 😁
    - question: "Do I need to be a student to attend?"
      answer: >
        Yes. Only students who are currently enrolled at a college/university or
        have graduated within the past 12 months are eligible to attend as hackers.
    - question: "Where is the event?"
      answer: >
